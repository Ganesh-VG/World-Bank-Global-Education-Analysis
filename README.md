# World Bank Global Education Analysis
The World Bank Education Statistics survey gathers extensive data from 217 countries and 25 country groups, comprising 8,86,930 rows and 69 columns. The dataset encompasses 3,665 indicators for comprehensive analysis. This project entails data wrangling, analysis, and visualization of education-related data sourced from national surveys, international assessments, and official statistics.

Through the World Bank Global Education Analysis Project, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the current state of education, monitor progress towards educational goals, and make informed decisions to support the development of inclusive and high-quality education systems globally.

Here are a few of the visualizations from the project:

In the above chart, the dropout rate during the transition from primary to secondary education is clearly visible. One of the prominent possible reasons is the lower per capita income. We can see that the lower the per capita income, the gap between enrollment in primary education and enrollment in secondary education increases. Therefore, an increase in the per capita income of the country can also bring an increase in enrollment into educational institutions.

From the graph, it is clearly visible that the increase in teacher recruitment will be a big boost to the primary education completion rate of the country. Schools need to have enough teachers for the country to develop. The pause in teacher recruitment will hamper the quality of future generations.

From the above plot, it is clearly visible that countries are on either side of the line with Ecuador topping the chart followed by Ukraine. With Chad being the worst performer followed by Niger. As we can see few countries have performed very poorly and need some hand-holding from fellow nations to develop over world as a whole.

The graph on the left categorizes the world population into various income levels, while the graph on the right illustrates the distribution of GDP among these income levels. Notably, the top 16.3% of the high-income population accounts for a significant 64.1% of the world's GDP. In contrast, the bottom 48.7% of low and lower-middle-income countries collectively represent only 8% of the global GDP. The above plot displays the inequality in income distribution around the world.

When it comes to the gender gap, in primary there is not much visible gap but as the students move into upper levels of education we can see that the school life expectancy of male students increases living behind their female counterparts except in a few cases where it is reversed.
Overall, school life expectancy tends to decrease as students progress from lower levels of education to higher ones. In some countries, particularly those with lower economic indicators, school life expectancy is notably lower compared to countries with higher economic status.
In tertiary education, most of the countries show significant gender gap where male population enjoy more school life expectancy than female population. It is also seen in much of the developed countries too.

As we can see, the world has achieved a significant milestone in providing primary education to a large portion of its population. However, there remains a considerable challenge in extending access to secondary and tertiary education. This is crucial to ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to benefit from the rapid technological advancements occurring globally and to foster holistic development worldwide.

From the above chart, it is clearly visible that internet usage per 100 people increases with an increase in the GDP per capita of the country. Low-income and heavily indebted poor countries have substantially low internet usage when compared to high and middle-income countries.
Internet usage data serves as a vital indicator of literacy and development within a country. Access to the internet opens doors to a plethora of knowledge and innovations in today's rapidly evolving world. The level of internet penetration in a country is closely linked to its overall development. It is imperative for low-income countries to receive support and assistance to bridge the digital divide and enhance their connectivity. High-income countries can contribute by providing used devices and infrastructure to facilitate internet access in less developed regions. With technology making global connectivity more accessible, the collective progress of all nations is crucial for global development and unity.

This is the pair plot for all the data collected. For more visualization and insights kindly visit the collab notebook thankyou.
